# Broadcast player-rating audit

The installed broadcast archive was parsed offline: **704 entries**, containing
1,350 definitions including aggregate copies. After deduplication, **41 templates
contain 239 player-rating cells**, using **31 attribute columns**. All those cells
are direct player queries with the default text format. Private extracted assets
and full reports remain under ignored `Evidence/PlayerFog/Presentations`.

| Presentation family | Rating fields found | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| Broadcast kicker graphic | Overall, kick power, kick accuracy | Static definition; visual output pending |
| Kick-returner graphic | Overall, speed, agility | Static definition |
| Pregame/runout/QB trot | Overall and position-specific attributes | Static definitions |
| Freshman debuts and player bios | Overall, speed, ball skills and other position attributes | Static definitions |
| Position/star-player comparisons | QB, RB, WR, TE, DE, MLB and safety attributes | Static definitions |
| Matchups to watch | Receiver/coverage, RB/LB, WR/LB and edge/QB comparisons | Static definitions |
| Legacy spotlight variants | QB overall, throw power/accuracy | Static definitions; presence does not establish use in current Dynasty |

## Separate playcall Kicker Range panel

The later screenshot identifies `art_screen.playcall.panel.KickerRange`, which
is separate from the broadcast definitions above. Its circular ACC/PWR badges
import `art_control.group.RatingValueItem`. p68 adds a dedicated asset bank for
the panel's initialization and range-refresh methods. Only `mcAccStat` and
`mcPowStat` are marked for the existing grade-label renderer; their numeric
`WidgetData.value` stays unchanged. Target line, distance remaining, yard
markers, player identity and range geometry remain native.

The panel's native 13- and 7-register frames are retained. Tests cover grade
boundaries, unknown/absent widgets, grade-color repaint and untouched distances
and geometry. A clean-session visual check remains pending.

## Broadcast implementation boundary

Football SystemMuse's `TextVariable` formatter converts an evaluated expression
into a **separate rendered string**. The candidate changes only that rendered
string, after native formatting. It does not change query results, ratings,
expression evaluation, comparisons or gameplay.

Conversion requires all of these:

- Exact native football `TextVariable` and direct `GameQueryVariable` classes.
- Exact player table `AGLP` and one of the 31 verified attribute columns.
- Default text format and a whole numeric rating in 0–100.
- A valid native rendered string cache and allocator.

Ordinary game/season/career statistics, statistical QB rating, team ratings,
jerseys, unknown values, nonnumeric text and other expressions retain native
formatting. Surrounding text such as “OVERALL RATING - ” is a separate text
variable and stays intact.

Startup validates the complete formatter body, exact vtable ownership, query
loader/evaluator layout and native string helper fingerprints. The callback uses
bounded local reads; it performs no process scans or background discovery.
Temporary strings use the game's constructor, reference-counted assignment and
destructor. The native formatter still receives its original input exactly once.

## Evidence and limits

- Offline tests cover all 31 columns × 101 ratings × three native numeric kinds,
  invalid/unknown values, non-player/statistic fields, foreign expression types,
  disabled forwarding and temporary-string lifetime.
- The live process's formatter body, vtable slots and helper code match the
  verified native fingerprints.
- Scene execution and visual output still require a live check. The static audit
  identifies definitions and supported fields; it does not claim that every
  legacy template can appear, or that arbitrary replacement assets use this path.
- Full p68 package includes the pre-snap substitution and playcall Kicker Range
  fixes. Isolated p67 tests
  only the presentation callback alongside p64; it has no reader, menu hooks or
  copied UI definitions and is not the automatic-loading package.

Repeat the offline audit with `python Tools/audit_player_presentations.py`.

## Playcall info-panel family audit

The current `Presentation_Common` collector was read separately from the older
research index. All **35 playcall panel assets** were extracted read-only and
decoded without errors. In particular, `TeamPositionGroups` has a newer asset
GUID than the historical index; the current collector resolves it correctly.
The private catalog is `Evidence/PlayerFog/PlaycallPanels/audit.json`.

| Panel | Treatment in p69 |
|---|---|
| IndividualPositionStats, including the pictured RB/FB Ratings | Grade the three final labels only when the native panel mode is Ratings (2) |
| PlayerVsPlayer | Grade up to three attribute pairs only in Ratings mode, after native comparisons and arrows are calculated |
| ImpactPlayerDepth | Grade its three explicit attribute labels after native selection and ordering |
| TeamPositionGroups | Grade each fresh row's player OVR display cell |
| TeamPositionGroups key-stat variant | Grade `ConferenceText`, where this layout puts player OVR; preserve `OverallText`, which contains the ordinary key statistic |
| Trench | Grade player OVR display cells in both lists; preserve weight averages |
| ConferenceRankings | Preserve: even the field called `Ovr` contains a season record here |
| SignedRecruits | Preserve: national rank, star rating and interest visualization |
| ImpactPlayerTraits | Preserve ability names, descriptions and tiers |
| ImpactPlayer / PlayerSelfComparison | Preserve generic statistics and comparisons; no confirmed rating-only path |

The new panel adapters keep native fonts and comparison foregrounds. This also
prevents grade colors from leaking into ordinary statistics when a cached panel
changes modes. Numeric input arrays, rating ordering, comparison arrows, player
IDs, jerseys, years, weight and ordinary statistics remain unchanged. Separate
asset banks use the original register frames and the existing attachment path;
no new native hook or background discovery is added.

Pre-snap Subs passed the user's p68 check. In p69 the user reports other panels
they encountered show grades, but The Trench still shows numeric player OVRs.
The Trench adapter attached successfully (bank 19, method 0). Kicker Range still
needs an explicit natural-scene check; the 35-asset audit is static evidence,
not a claim that every panel has appeared in the current game.

## Bound list refresh correction (p70)

The native Trench method binds its left/right providers before the appended
adapter executes. p69 assigned `row.ExtraInfo.OverallText` directly, which bypasses
the provider's change notification. `InfoPanelListItem.Draw` refreshes that label
only when its label invalidation flag is set. Updating the backing dictionary
therefore does not ensure an already-bound renderer repaints.

p70 uses the verified native `UpdateProperty(index, propertyName, value)` path
for the one player OVR cell. Its notification flows through `VirtualItemAdapter`,
which copies the renderer's ExtraInfo, changes the named property and calls
`SetExtraInfo`. Other fields and nested style/function references are preserved.
The same correction applies to the two TeamPositionGroups layouts, whose OVR
cells are `OverallText` and `ConferenceText` respectively. The latter layout's
ordinary key statistic in `OverallText` remains numeric.

These exact player OVR cells also accept canonical integer strings `"0"` through
`"100"`. No arbitrary numeric coercion is used: padded, signed, decimal, percentage,
unit-bearing and sentinel strings are rejected. Existing letter labels are
no-ops. This guards a possible source representation; the temporary row probe
captured no matching rows, so it did not establish the live Trench value type.
Both probe hooks were stopped successfully.

Regression tests model a bound renderer with its own cached ExtraInfo and require
the native field-specific notification to update its visible label. They cover
all 101 numeric and canonical-string ratings, both unequal Trench lists, repeat
visits, unknowns, source IDs, native style/function identity and numeric weight
averages. Original fixed register frames are retained; no new production hook,
background scan or per-frame polling is added. The user subsequently confirmed
The Trench fix in p70. The installed recruiting runtime checksum matches the
verified p70 DLL. This closes that specific display leak; Kicker Range and any
unseen presentation scenes retain their separate verification status.

## Kicker Range numeric-text correction (p71)

The p70 live screenshot still shows ACC64/PWR64, despite both Kicker Range
methods attaching. A bounded read-only capture of the actual badge objects
confirms that both `mData.value` fields contain the **string** `"64"`, not a
number. Their text children also display `"64"`, and the private rating marker
is absent. The old numeric-only guard exits before marking these widgets.

p71 opts in only these two badges to strict canonical integer-text conversion,
while preserving the original `mData.value`. The marker is installed before
checking value/child readiness so deferred initialization can finish normally.
Initial paint, marked `RatingValueItem.Draw`, and a new privately gated
`RatingValueItem.SetValue` suffix all use the same parser. SetValue needs its
own suffix because its native body directly resets the child label. Its original
four-register frame is retained. Other shared team/stat badges keep their
existing behavior, and ordinary field distances, range geometry, labels and
circle colors remain native.

Tests include all 101 numeric and canonical-string ratings, missing/deferred
children, native value updates, style-reset redraws, reused kicker widgets,
unknown/formatted values, marker exclusions and unchanged numeric source data.
The existing Trench tests pass after moving their identical parser into the
shared builder. No new production native hook or background work is introduced.
Native tests, all 11 UI suites, independent review and MMC packaging pass.
The diagnostic probes are stopped; final p71 Kicker Range visual confirmation
remains pending.

## Separate Rime lineup and Game Changers reports

The user later reported numeric player OVRs in the opening offensive-line
lineup and Game Changers. These are **not** the playcall Trench panel or direct
Muse player-rating queries. The lineup banner supplies player IDs to a Rime
screen; its reusable `PlayerInfoDisplay` widget reads `PROP_OVERALLRATING` from
a player datasource and converts that integer with `IntToFormattedString`.
Jersey numbers use a separate converter. Game Changers corresponds to
`CFB_Dynamic_Duo`, with two analogous OVR connections. Their nearby yards,
catches and touchdown counts are ordinary statistics.

The read-only asset audit resolved these exact native graphs and identified
the integer formatter's handlers and native string lifetime. However, no live
entity was captured before the user left the game, so the association between
a live converter and its owning rating connection is not yet verified. The
temporary observer was stopped successfully. p72 includes **no** Rime formatter
replacement and no Flags-only or blanket numeric conversion. These two reported
broadcast leaks remain open; the existing direct-Muse formatter coverage does
not imply coverage of Rime datasource labels.

## Pause Injury Report attributes (p72)

The in-game Injury Report uses a legacy adapter that calls
`GetRelevantSkillsFromPlayer`. The shared player module normalizes its
`skillLabel`/`skillValue` records into six attribute slots. This bypasses the
modern Injury response conversion: the reported screenshot had a graded Overall
badge but numeric values in all six tiles.

p72 marks the module only from that exact screen's selection/refresh method.
The parent passes a private injury marker to its attribute slots, which convert
only fully revealed values. This path's native `roster` flag defaults to false,
so it is not used as a guard. Source skill values, Overall, player identity,
injury status and recovery text remain untouched. Unknown values and unrelated
shared modules retain their existing behavior. One additional asset bank uses
the existing script dispatch, retention and stop guards; no native hook or
background search is added.

Numeric/text six-attribute fixtures, changed players, native `roster=false`,
hidden values and unmarked modules pass alongside the card, Formation and full
native/UI suites. The combined p72 package includes the p71 Kicker Range change.
Both new fixes still require visual confirmation after installation.

## Lightning Combination follow-up (options-p96)

The user reported numeric OVR72 for both players in the Lightning Combination
banner. This belongs to the same separate Dynamic Duo family as Game Changers;
its passing/receiving statistics are not player ratings. A development-only,
four-minute pass-through observer captured 58 integer formatter instances in
the running game. None established a verified live association with the OVR
connection. It restored both observed vtable slots and drained all in-flight
callbacks (stop result 0). It did not change source values or displayed text.

The package therefore retains this as an open leak, alongside opening lineups.
The production build does not contain that observer or a generic numeric
formatter replacement. The five-scale/player-team separation work does not
close this independent Rime presentation gap.
